## Story

Passionate sport lover since I born. In fact I used to be good in physical training even in elementary school. During this time our teacher asked me whether I want to join to the athletics (track and fields) training group. Besides playing basketball in our freetime we used to practice sprinting, long-jumping and throwing. Thanks to my prematurity I achieved very good results and soon I was going to competitions week by week. I remember these times as very happy era of my life.

> "Literally I couldn't believe it...maybe only after I realized my father how proud of me."

Suddenly a new coach appeared who asked me to join to a local sport club called Lelkesed&eacute;s SK. I was full of joy and very excited to be a part of something bigger. I met a lot of new people here who also become my best friends and even my family. This time we went regularly to national or local competitions of athletics. In 2000 we also won the 4x100m sprint relay in the national competition. Literally I couldn't believe it...maybe only after I realized my father how proud of me. Sooner or later my prematurity went down and also my scores got low which made me very unhappy and lost faith in this sport.

After athletics I became a regular guy who just going to the gym and working out with machines 3 times a week. Although I liked it at first, I did not give me enough result...or at least how much I expect. To overcome this I was regularly switching gyms, diet, training plan, etc. None of them worked for real.

> "A bell with a kettle? What is going on here?"

Sooner or later I realized that I'm not doing any sports and I'm not fit at all. This time I hear about a new sport called Kettlebell. A bell with a kettle? What is going on here? I immediately signed up for a new beginner course and I pretty much liked it. Swings, swings and more swings. Literally all the time we were practicing swings beside snatches, cleans or presses. It was challenging and gave me a good knowledge about functional sports. However it was very static. We were always standing in the exact same place for an hour and working out. It was exhausting for sure but not enough for me. So after a while I stopped it. Then after a few months I saw an advertisement of Crossfit on a social website.

> "I became an addict...a WOD addict"

I have to be honest, I instantly wanted to be quit from Crossfit after the first free training. It was very-very-very exhausting. I couldn't believe how people can like this or doing this all the time. It was killing me. However a friend and colleague of mine told me that he will continue even though he was cracked as well. So we were keep going to the beginner Crossfit course and sooner or later I became an addict...a WOD addict. I was proud of my body, my mentality, my lifestyle and my friends in the game. The community which gave me strength to push myself forward and more forward. And even now I'm an athlete who is doing what he loves...doing Crossfit.
