*Warmup*

### Weightlifting

| Exercise       | Sets | Reps       | %       | Weight   |
| -------------- | ---- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| Bench          | 3    | 3 -> 2,1,1 | 88%     | 100      |
| DB Bench Press | 4+   | 5 -> 8     | RIR 2-3 | @ 2x30kg |
| Squat          | 4    | 5 -> 4     | 83%     | 127.5    |
| Squat          | 2+   | 8          | 73%     | 112.5    |

@ I had to change the reps because i still dont feel enough power. Probably my  PRs have to recalculated because back then i was able to do 5 reps with 100kg bench.
