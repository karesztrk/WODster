## Tuesday

*Warmup*

### Weightlifting

| Exercise                           | Sets | Reps   | %    | Weight     |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| High Hang Snatch                   | 4    | 1      | 80%  | 72.5       |
| Hang Clean + Power Jerk            | 3    | 2 -> 1 | 85%  | 92.5       |
| Push Jerk Behind The Neck in Split | 3    | 3      | 65%  | 72.5       |
| Push Press (off Jerk Max)          | 2    | 2      | 75%  | 87.5 -> 80 |
| Snatch Pulls                       | 4    | 1      | 110% | 100        |
| Clean Pulls                        | 4    | 1      | 110% | 120        |

Snatch was a success today but the Clean&Jerk felt heavy again. So i've decreased it to one rep only. The push-press also went wrong. After 80kg, my technique had been broken or something. Nothing worked above this weight...even after going back to 80kg.

### Accessory

2 rounds of 2'

* Bird-dog plank (10" each side)
