* 10-10 Bulgarian split-squat
* 10 Push-up into 5 Diamon push-up

### Weightlifting

| Excersie | Sets | Reps | %   | Weight | Rest   |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ------ | ------ |
| Squat    | 5    | 10   | 65% | 100    | 2-3min |
| Bench    | 5    | 10   | 65% | 75     | 2-3min |

@ Both the squat and the bench was challanging. Altough the squats went UB, I had to break the last set of the Bench press into 8-2. Movements felt OK, I had dynamic movements.

### Metcon

15-20" biking
