@ I've rushed the warmup again. The back squat went successful. But i couldnt complete neither of the Front-squat. Only 2 reps had been made along the 3 sets. It might be the cause of the Bodybuilding from the weekend. Bench was a little bit better but the last exercise had to be split into 7-3. Reverse grip also reduced from 8 to 6 because it was incredibly hard.
