@ This was a hard day. Except the for first exercise, nothing went UB. The front-squat was incredibly hard and I dont know what could be the problem. Interestingly the reverse grip bench was OKish during the 2-3 set, I've felt it stable.

### Accessory

3 sets of:

* 10 (RIR 2-3) Triceps pull-down @ band
* 10 (RIR 2-3) Seated DB curls @ 10-10kg DB
