## Monday

### Warmup

* 50 Single-unders
* 10 Push-up + 5 Diamon push-up
* 8-8 Bulgarian split-squat
* 30" Wall-sit
* 15 Hollow-rock
* 10 Shoulder-pass

| Exercise                 | Sets | Reps | %   | Weight     |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- | --- | ---------- |
| Squat                    | 3    | 5    | 75% | 117.5      |
| Paused Front Squat       | 3    | 5    | 70% | 97.5       |
| Bench                    | 2    | 8    | 70% | 80         |
| Bench                    | 2    | 12   | 60% | 70         |
| Reverse Grip Bench Press | 2+   | 8    | 60% | 50         |
| Pullups                  | 3    | 10   | BW+ | +0/2,5/5kg |

@ Back squats went OK but the Paused FS had to be changed from the prescribed percentage. Originally it was based on back squat percentage. 2nd exercise of Bench had to be split because it was too much for one set. Also Reverse Grip was a very new thing. So the weight had been scaled down from 70 -> 50kg. Pull-up were OK with the plus weight.

### Accessory

3 sets:

* 10/10 windmile
* 10 hollow rock +15" hold
* 10 V-up
* 5 Plank to push up pos. +45" plank hold
