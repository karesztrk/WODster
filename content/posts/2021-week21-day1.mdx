@ It was really-really hard today. I felt that i need to be more dynamic and aggresive on the eccentric part of the squats. The Front-squat is done with a belt. The last set of the bench had been split into 8-4. But I was happy that I could work with the prescribed weight on the Reverse Grip Bench...but fewer than 8 reps. Pull-ups went great.

### Accessory

* Skull-crusher
* Hammer-curl
