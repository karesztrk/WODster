| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ---- | --- | ------ | -------- |
| Tall Clean and Power Jerk            | 2    | 3    | 50% | 55     | 1min     |
| Power Clean + Push Press             | 3    | 1    | 70% | 77.5   | 1min     |
| Clean + 2 Jerk                       | 4    | 1    | 78% | 85     | EMOM     |
| Hang Clean with Pause at Knee + Jerk | 4    | 1    | 83% | 92.5   | EMOM     |
| Clean and Jerk                       | 3    | 1    | 88% | 97.5   | EMOM     |
| Deadlift                             | 6    | 5    | 75% | 150    | 1.5-2min |

@ Movements were good until the big weights had been reached. Espcially the last 88% sets were bad. Lesson learned: before each exercise/movement go back to a lower weight to be familiar with the proper movement and mechanics. Deadlifts were ok ... tho i used a silencer pad.
