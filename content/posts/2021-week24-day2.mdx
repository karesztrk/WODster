@ Still sore from the previous days. The 2nd snatch was always instable. But c&j was terrible. I didnt find enough power to do the 3rd rep. Usually failed on the clean itself. The other accessory lifts were OK.

### Accessory

3 sets:

* 12 Ball-exchange
* 20 Bicycle crunch
* 10/10 Side plank rotation
* 45" Swiss-ball plank
