## Friday

*Mobility flow*

### Movement prep

3 sets:

* Double KB walking lunge x 14 steps
* Banded Pull Apart (Palms up) x 15
* 1 OHS + 1 Sots Press x 5 reps (PVC Pipe)

### Oly

**Pause Snatch Balance**: 3,3,2,2,1,1. Work up to a challenging weight. Pause for two seconds in the bottom of each rep.

@ Up to 85kg

**Pause Rack Jerk** (Once you recover your jerk, youâ€™ll hold the bar overhead for 5 slow seconds before reracking the barbell): 5 working sets. I want you to pick a heavyish weight that you can hit for 5 singles.

@ Up to 85kg

\
**Pause Snatches from Blocks** (bar should be right above the knee. Pause in receive for two seconds before standing): 5x2

@ 60/60/60/65/70 with couple of fails. Barbell have fallen behind my back = probably feets were too narrow

\
**Snatch Deadlift**: 3x3 @ 100% of best snatch

@ 90kg
