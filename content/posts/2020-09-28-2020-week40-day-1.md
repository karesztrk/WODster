* Double DB OH Hold: 30 seconds @ 2x22,5kg DBs

### Oly

**Back Squat:** 3-3-2-2-1-1. Work up to a heavy single for the day (this doesn’t have to be a PR! Just go as heavy as you can for this day!)

@ Up to 140kg

**Snatch Deadlift + Power Snatch + Snatch High Pull + Snatch**: 4-5 working sets. Move up in Weight each set and build to a moderate load.

@ Done /w 70kg x 4

**Snatch Deadlift**: 3x3 as heavy as possible with good, fast form.

@ Done /w 110kg

**Back Squat**: 2x10. These should be light enough to where you can move really fast. But not so light to where you’re not pushing! Make it burn

@ Done /w 70-75kg
